# Hi there, I'm Soham ðŸ‘‹

I am a Machine Learning Practitioner with experience in developing and deploying models for various industries. I am passionate about working in the field of big data and distributed systems and have worked on several projects involving data processing at scale.

My expertise includes natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. I am proficient in Python and have experience using frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Additionally, I am always eager to learn about new techniques and tools to improve my work.

Outside of machine learning, I am interested in researching in Neuromorphic Computing and Bioinformatics. These areas fascinate me because they offer unique opportunities to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and biological systems.

If you would like to collaborate on a project or discuss my work further, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via [email](sohamt09@gmail.com).
